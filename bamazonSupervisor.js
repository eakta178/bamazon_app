// Create a new MySQL table called departments. Your table should include the following columns:
// department_id

// department_name

// over_head_costs (A dummy number you set for each department)

// Modify the products table so that there's a product_sales column and modify the bamazonCustomer.js 
// app so that this value is updated with each 
// individual products total revenue from each sale.

// Modify your bamazonCustomer.js app so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, the 
// price of the product multiplied by the quantity purchased is added to the product's product_sales column.

// Make sure your app still updates the inventory listed in the products column.
// Create another Node app called bamazonSupervisor.js. Running this application will list a set of 
// menu options:
// View Product Sales by Department

// Create New Department

// When a supervisor selects View Product Sales by Department, the app should display a summarized table 
// in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.
